# CLITodoList

I am trying to pick up haskell, and more generically functionall programming languages. This project
I will try to make a CLI todo list, which SHOULD be fairly simple. So we will see how this goes!

In the future I want to make a more complex project using Haskell, but for now this is where I will start
to learn basic syntax and how functional languages work.
